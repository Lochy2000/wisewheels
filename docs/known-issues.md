# Known Issues

## Critical Issues

### 1. Expo Router Configuration Error

**Status**: üî¥ Critical - App Cannot Start

**Description**: The app fails to start with the error `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'config')` in the BottomTabBar component.

**Error Details**:
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'config')
at getPathFromState (entry.bundle:85578:19)
at BottomTabBar (entry.bundle:74810:26)
```

**Root Cause**: Version incompatibility between Expo Router 4.0.17 and React Navigation dependencies.

**Impact**: 
- App completely unusable
- Cannot access any features
- Affects all platforms (web, iOS, Android)

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. ‚úÖ Downgraded Expo SDK from 53.0.0 to 52.0.30
2. ‚úÖ Downgraded Expo Router from 5.0.2 to 4.0.17
3. ‚úÖ Created LucideIcon wrapper to fix icon import issues
4. ‚ùå Dependency cleanup and reinstallation
5. ‚ùå Cache clearing and fresh installs

**Current Workaround**: None available

**Recommended Solution**: 
- Create local development environment outside of WebContainer
- Use compatible dependency versions
- Consider upgrading to latest stable Expo SDK with compatible router version

## High Priority Issues

### 2. Mock Data Dependencies

**Status**: üü° High Priority

**Description**: Most features rely on mock data instead of real API integrations.

**Affected Features**:
- Route planning (OpenRouteService integration pending)
- Place discovery (Wheelmap API integration pending)
- Nearby places on home screen

**Impact**:
- Limited functionality for end users
- Cannot test real-world scenarios
- Inaccurate data for accessibility planning

**Solution**: Implement planned API integrations with proper error handling and fallbacks.

### 3. Missing Authentication System

**Status**: üü° High Priority

**Description**: No user authentication system implemented.

**Impact**:
- All users appear as "Anonymous User"
- No personalized experiences
- Cannot track user contributions
- No user preferences or saved data

**Dependencies**: Supabase Auth integration

**Solution**: Implement Supabase Auth with email/password and social login options.

## Medium Priority Issues

### 4. Limited Offline Functionality

**Status**: üü† Medium Priority

**Description**: App requires internet connection for all features.

**Impact**:
- Unusable in areas with poor connectivity
- Cannot access previously viewed routes or places
- No offline hazard report queue

**Solution**: Implement offline caching and queue system for essential features.

### 5. No Real-Time Location Tracking

**Status**: üü† Medium Priority

**Description**: Location is only fetched once on app startup.

**Impact**:
- Inaccurate "nearby" results when user moves
- No turn-by-turn navigation capability
- Cannot provide location-based alerts

**Solution**: Implement background location tracking with user permission.

### 6. Missing Accessibility Features

**Status**: üü† Medium Priority

**Description**: Despite being an accessibility app, some accessibility features are incomplete.

**Missing Features**:
- Screen reader optimization
- Voice navigation
- High contrast mode implementation
- Large text size support
- Haptic feedback for important actions

**Solution**: Implement comprehensive accessibility features following WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.

## Low Priority Issues

### 7. Performance Optimization

**Status**: üü¢ Low Priority

**Description**: App performance could be improved for better user experience.

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Image loading and caching
- List virtualization for large datasets
- Bundle size optimization
- Memory usage optimization

**Solution**: Implement performance optimizations and monitoring.

### 8. Limited Error Handling

**Status**: üü¢ Low Priority

**Description**: Error handling could be more comprehensive and user-friendly.

**Issues**:
- Generic error messages
- No retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Limited offline error handling
- No error reporting system

**Solution**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages and recovery options.

### 9. Missing Analytics

**Status**: üü¢ Low Priority

**Description**: No analytics or usage tracking implemented.

**Impact**:
- Cannot measure feature usage
- No insights into user behavior
- Cannot identify areas for improvement
- No crash reporting

**Solution**: Implement privacy-focused analytics and crash reporting.

## Platform-Specific Issues

### Web Platform

#### 1. Limited Native Features
- No haptic feedback
- Limited location accuracy
- No camera access in some browsers
- No push notifications

#### 2. Performance Issues
- Slower than native apps
- Limited offline capabilities
- Browser compatibility variations

### Mobile Platforms

#### 1. Permission Handling
- Complex location permission flows
- Camera permission edge cases
- Background location limitations

#### 2. Platform Differences
- iOS vs Android navigation differences
- Different accessibility API implementations
- Platform-specific design guidelines

## Development Environment Issues

### 1. WebContainer Limitations

**Description**: Current development environment has limitations that affect development and testing.

**Limitations**:
- Cannot install certain native dependencies
- Limited debugging capabilities
- No access to device features for testing
- Performance limitations for complex operations

**Solution**: Set up local development environment for full feature development.

### 2. API Key Management

**Description**: Secure API key management in development environment.

**Issues**:
- API keys exposed in client-side code
- No secure key rotation mechanism
- Limited environment separation

**Solution**: Implement server-side proxy for sensitive API operations.

## Workarounds and Temporary Solutions

### 1. Mock Data Usage

**Current Approach**: Use realistic mock data that matches expected API response formats.

**Benefits**:
- Allows UI development and testing
- Consistent data for development
- No API rate limiting during development

**Limitations**:
- Not representative of real-world data
- Cannot test error scenarios
- Limited data variety

### 2. Anonymous User System

**Current Approach**: All users treated as anonymous with generic identifiers.

**Benefits**:
- No authentication complexity
- Immediate app usage
- Privacy-focused approach

**Limitations**:
- No personalization
- Cannot track user contributions
- No user preferences

### 3. Client-Side API Integration

**Current Approach**: All API calls made directly from client.

**Benefits**:
- Simple implementation
- No server infrastructure required
- Direct API access

**Limitations**:
- API keys exposed
- No request caching or optimization
- Limited error handling
